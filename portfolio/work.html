		<h1>My Design Experience</p>
		<p>I am pretty new to the world of design, but I've already had a chance to work on several projects. I am most interested in creating communities through my designs, and designing technologies that encourage people to not only interact with their phones and computers, but each other and the world around them. These projects have allowed me to develop various skills that I can use across disciplines. For more information, see below!</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>Litebox: Design for Adult Literacy</p>
			<p>My team and I designed a prototype of a learning assistant for adults with lower reading levels that provides help with daily tasks and long-term reading comprehension. This project was selected as a finalist for the CHI 2018 Student Design Competition in Montreal.</p>
			<p>Pet Mingle</p>
			<p>I designed and developed a prototype for an application that allows "animal owners" and "animal lovers" to connect with each other and form a community based on a mutual love of their furry friends.</p>
			<p>Botanical Gardens Labeling Process</p>
			<p>My team and I performed a contextual inquiry on the internal plant labeling process at the local botanical gardens, and provided recommendations using various methods such as affinity diagrams and information visualizations.</p>
