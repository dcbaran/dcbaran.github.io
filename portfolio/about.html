		<h1>Hi, I'm Denise</h1>
		<h5>ux designer</h5><h5>/</h5><h5>tea drinker</h5><h5>/</h5><h5>animal lover</h5><h5>/</h5><h5>people watcher</h5><h5>/</h5><h5>avid reader</h5>
		<p>I'm Denise, the creator of this website. I'm passionate about  experience design, content strategy, and empathy for users above all. My mission as I gain more experience in design is to absorb as much knowledge as I can from as many human perspectives as possible in order to truly do some good with what I create.</p>
		<p>Outside of school, my passion is animals. I love dogs a lot in particular, and I spent a lot of my free time volunteering at the Humane Society of Huron Valley. I am a firm supporter of the #adoptdontshop movement, because every dog in a shelter deserves a loving home.</p>
