			<p class = "more-padding">Welcome to the Accessibility Audit website for the University of Michigan. This site was created to showcase accessibility problems on U-Mâ€™s campus and bring them to the attention of faculty, staff, and students at U-M.</p>
			<h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
			<p class = "less-padding">Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. It can also be viewed as the ability to access and benefit from some system or entity.</p>
			<p class = "less-padding">As you explore the gallery and my analyses of accessibility problems on U-M's campus, I invite you to to ask yourself what these problems say to the people who face them daily. For example, how might it feel to have to navigate to the back of a building rather than enter at the front with everyone else?</p>
			<p class = "less-padding">These are important problems to raise to the administration at this university to make everyone feel welcomed and included, regardless of their ability.</p>
