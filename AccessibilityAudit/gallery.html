			<h4>Entrances</h4>
  			<p>Angell Hall has one accessible entrance on the left side of the main staircase. On the right side of the staircase, there is a ground-level door that from a distance looks accessible due to a small blue sign with the international symbol of accessibility on it, but upon viewing the door more closely, a visitor can see that there is a small step leading up to the door, and the accessibility sign actually has an arrow under it that points to the right. The arrow points directly at a wall. The large, grand staircase is not accessible for those with physical disabilities, but a small blue sign points to the left (this time, in the correct direction) indicating that there is an accessible entrance to the left of the staircase.</p>
			<p>A ramp leads down to the accessible entrance, which requires both a keycard scan and the pressing of a button to enter the building.</p>

  			<p>The Chemistry Building has several accessible entrances, some that are confusingly marked with a sign of accessibility but don’t possess any features that make them accessible (such as a button that opens the door or an automatic motion-sensing door), and some that look accessible from a distance but actually have a small arrow indicating that the door marked with the sign is not the actual accessible door.</p>
			<p>The entrance facing the Michigan League is the only entrance that actually has a button that will open the door when pushed.</p>

  			<h4>Entrances</h4>
  			<p>The Dana Building has a staircase in the diag entrance, which means it is inaccessible for those who might want to access the building but are in a wheelchair or have another physical disability. A door on the left side of the building has a sign indicating it is accessible, and a button to open the door. However, there is no keycard to scan student/faculty/staff MCards, so this door is simply locked on the weekend.</p>
			<p>In the back of the building, there is a door with both a keycard scanner and a button to open the door. The door, however, is a fair distance from both the button and the keycard, so the visitor must hurry if they want to get inside before the door closes.</p>

  			<p>Hatcher Graduate Library is not accessible from the front, despite having a set of ramps on either side of its large, front staircase. The ramps are too steep to be used by wheelchairs, so there are two blue signs indicating that the ramps are not accessible. Using the same sign and color for a sign that indicates inaccessibility could be confusing for anyone trying to enter the building who is looking for an accessible entrance.</p>
			<p>The visitor must circle all the way around to the back of the building, once again passing an entrance with a staircase on their way.</p>
			<p>The back entrance is the accessible one, where the visitor can find a keycard and a button to open the doors and enter the building.</p>

  			<p>Randall Laboratory has several ground-level entrances, but only one is accessible, meaning it is equipped with a button and keycard scanner that will open the door automatically. There is additionally an wheelchair lift behind this door, next to the staircase.</p>
  			<p>In the arch to the diag that is a part of Randall, there is a confusingly placed, thick, cylindrical concrete post in the center of the walkway.
